		<h2>Serenity Soul senory garden</h2>
		<p>Join Eucae Bonnets and Serenity Soul to tour our newest garden, the Sensory Garden. Studies have shown that Sensory Gardens provide therapeutic benefits, particularly for children and adults with special needs. This Sensory Garden is devoted to raised plant beds emphasizing the five senses: sight, smell, hearing, taste, and touch.<br>
		From the wafting lavender to snappy peas, from rustling grasses to chiming bamboo, this garden tour will inspire your curiosity and green thumb! It’s also designed to permit wheelchair access and other accessibility concerns.<br>
		This tour is FREE for children under 12 and is just $5 for general entry.<a href="contact.html"> Contact us  on how to sign up.</a></p>
